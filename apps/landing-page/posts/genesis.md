## The Trust Gap

AI agents are rapidly becoming the primary drivers of digital commerce. However, there remains a critical gap: **Verifiable Trust**. How do we know an agent is acting on behalf of a real human? How do we verify its constraints?

## Enter APP

The **Agent Proof Protocol (APP)** is designed to bridge this gap. By providing a standardized gateway for identity verification, intent mandates, and secure settlement, we enable a world where agents can be trusted as much as human counterparts.

### Key Features
- **Identity Proof**: Hardware-backed biometric liveness.
- **Intent Mandates**: Cryptographically signed scope constraints.
- **Gateway Interoperability**: Seamless bridging between various payment rails.

Stay tuned as we build the future of agentic integrity.
