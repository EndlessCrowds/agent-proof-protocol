# Agent Proof Protocol (APP) v2.1
## The Universal Execution Layer for Agentic Commerce

> "Visa authorizes the spend. Google defines the intent. We verify the reality."

## 1. Abstract: The TCP/IP of Labor
The global economy is currently undergoing a phase transition of historical magnitude: the shift from the Information Age to the Agentic Era. In this new epoch, software no longer merely retrieves information; it autonomously executes economic actions.

However, this transition is currently arrested by a "Last Mile" infrastructure failure. The three critical pillars of the autonomous economy are speaking mutually unintelligible dialects:
*   **Identity (Google AP2):** Defines what the agent wants to achieve (Intent).
*   **Finance (Visa TAP):** Defines how the agent pays (Authorization).
*   **Execution (The Physical World):** Remains a fragmented, opaque, and disconnected layer of incompatible labor marketplaces, siloed APIs, and closed loops.

The Agent Proof Protocol (APP) resolves this deadlock by establishing the Universal Execution Layer. Just as TCP/IP allowed disparate networks to communicate by standardizing packet transmission, APP standardizes the transmission of Work Orders. It functions as a deterministic middleware—a "Universal Translation Gateway"—that ingests digital mandates from Google and Visa, translates them into semantic "Labor Primitives," and routes them for execution by a cryptographically verified human workforce.

By standardizing the interface between Silicon Intelligence and Biological Execution, APP ensures that the rise of autonomous agents acts as a permanent, high-velocity stimulus for human labor. We are building the stable economic bridge where Demand is Digital, and Supply is Biological.

## 2. The Interoperability Thesis: The Atomic Bridge
APP v2.1 is the first protocol architecture designed explicitly to bridge the three dominant standards of the next decade. It provides the "connective tissue" that allows a silicon brain to move a biological hand without friction.

### 2.1 The Translation Engine (Kernel Logic)
The core of APP is a deterministic logic gate that normalizes traffic between isolated ecosystems. It abstracts the complexity of the supply chain, allowing an Agent to be "Platform Agnostic."

| Layer | Standard | The APP Translation Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingress (Intent)** | Google AP2 | **The Brain.** APP accepts the Intent_Mandate (JSON). It parses complex, unstructured goals (e.g., "My server room is hot") into a specific, executable Labor Primitive (PRIMITIVE: MAINTAIN). |
| **Auth (Finance)** | Visa TAP | **The Wallet.** APP accepts the Agent_Auth_Token. It holds this fiat authorization in a Smart Escrow Contract, acting as the "Oracle" that triggers final settlement only when physical truth is verified. |
| **Identity (Trust)** | ERC-8004 | **The Passport.** APP validates the Agent's on-chain reputation before dispatching a human. This prevents "Sybil Attacks" where malicious bots spam physical workers with fake requests. |
| **Egress (Reality)** | APP v2.1 | **The Hand.** Routes the normalized request to the optimal physical provider via the Liquidity Assurance Protocol. |

### 2.2 The "Atomic Bridge" Workflow
To visualize the power of this bridge, consider a single atomic transaction:
1.  **Google Layer:** An Agent sends an intent: "Verify shelf stock at 5th Ave store."
2.  **Visa Layer:** The Agent attaches a Visa Token locking $50.00 in funding.
3.  **APP Layer:** The Translation Engine converts this to `PRIMITIVE: VERIFY` and broadcasts it to the local mesh.
4.  **Physical Layer:** A Human "Sensor" executes the task and provides Proof of Physics (Wi-Fi RTT).
5.  **Settlement:** APP validates the proof and generates a Settlement_Token.
6.  **Finality:** The Visa network sees the token and instantaneously releases the $50.00 to the worker's wallet.

## 3. The 5 Labor Primitives (The Schema)
Complexity is the enemy of automation. To enable seamless machine-to-human commerce, the Protocol semantically reduces the infinite complexity of human effort into five distinct, atomic "Verbs."

| Primitive | Semantic Action | Target Supply | Validation Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VERIFY** | The Eyes | Native Swarm (Direct P2P) | Wi-Fi RTT + Witness Chain. Used for ground truth, retail audits, and anti-spoofing. |
| **FIX** | The Hands | Residential / Assembly | Proof of Completion. Used for unskilled labor, furniture assembly, and cleaning. |
| **MAINTAIN** | The Hands (Pro) | Enterprise / Licensed | Proof of License. Cryptographic validation of trade credentials (HVAC, Electrical, IT). |
| **MOVE** | The Wheels | Logistics / Courier | Package Passport. A QR-based handshake that links digital ownership to physical custody. |
| **THINK** | The Brain | RLHF / Cognitive Review | Consensus. Used for data labeling, reinforcement learning, and subjective review. |

## 4. The Liquidity Assurance Protocol (Fail-Safe Routing)
An infrastructure protocol cannot fail. APP guarantees 100% Liquidity via a "Waterfall" routing mechanism that optimizes for Latency, Cost, and Certainty.

### Priority 0: The Native Swarm (Layer 1 P2P)
*   **Architecture:** Direct Machine-to-Human connection via the APP Client.
*   **Logic:** The Protocol always queries this layer first. It leverages "Zero-Hop" routing to connect agents directly to local human sensors.
*   **Benefit:** Zero-latency execution with no API middleware friction.

### Priority 1: The Aggregator Bridge (Layer 2 Legacy Adapter)
*   **Architecture:** API Proxy / Adapter Pattern.
*   **Logic:** If the Native Swarm is saturated, the Protocol acts as a "Universal API Client," programmatically purchasing labor from legacy pools to guarantee execution. The Protocol maintains active adapters for the following Global Liquidity Pools:
    *   **Logistics Module (MOVE):**
        *   Uber Direct: For instant point-to-point urban courier services.
        *   DoorDash Drive: For last-mile retail logistics.
        *   Roadie: For long-haul or bulky item transport.
    *   **General Labor Module (FIX):**
        *   TaskRabbit: For residential assembly and minor repairs.
        *   Thumbtack: For specialized home services.
    *   **Skilled Trade Module (MAINTAIN):**
        *   Field Nation: For IT infrastructure, cabling, and low-voltage work.
        *   WorkMarket (ADP): For enterprise-grade licensed contractors.
    *   **Cognitive Module (THINK):**
        *   Scale AI: For RLHF and data annotation tasks.
        *   Amazon MTurk: For micro-consensus tasks.
*   **Benefit:** Infinite liquidity depth. The Agent never receives a "No Service" error; the protocol simply routes to the next available provider.

### Priority 2: The Economic Surge (Market Clearing)
*   **Architecture:** Public Bounty Broadcast.
*   **Logic:** If no provider accepts the task at the reserve price, the Protocol enters "Surge Mode." It broadcasts the task to the open web with dynamic pricing, autonomously raising the bounty second-by-second until a market-clearing price is discovered by a human actor.

## 5. Trust & Verification: The DePIN Stack
In an era of Deepfakes and AI voice synthesis, "Digital Trust" is dead. We replace "Trust" with "Proof." We rely on the laws of physics to verify reality.

### 5.1 Proof of Location (IEEE 802.11mc)
GPS is passive and easily spoofed. APP v2.1 mandates Wi-Fi RTT (Round Trip Time).
*   **The Physics:** The protocol measures the Time of Flight of radio signals between the worker's device and nearby Wi-Fi Access Points (Anchors). Since the speed of light is constant ($c$), this measurement cannot be faked via software.
*   **Witness Chain:** The measurement is cryptographically signed by the device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), creating an unforgeable "Proof of Physics" that confirms the worker is physically present at the task location.

### 5.2 Identity: ERC-8004
*   **Agents:** Must present a valid ERC-8004 identity to interact with the protocol. This creates an on-chain reputation score for AI Agents, preventing spam.
*   **Workers:** Utilize Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to prove "Humanity" and "Reputation" without revealing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the machine.

## 6. Settlement: The x402 Standard
The legacy financial system (Net-30, Chargebacks) is incompatible with autonomous agents that operate at the speed of code. APP v2.1 implements HTTP 402 (Payment Required).
*   **Mechanism:** When an Agent requests a task, the API responds with a 402 Payment Required header containing a Lightning Network invoice or Stablecoin challenge.
*   **Streaming:** For time-based tasks (THINK / MAINTAIN), funds stream second-by-second. This transforms labor from a debt-based contract ("I'll pay you in 2 weeks") to a real-time asset swap.
*   **Finality:** Settlement is atomic. The `Settlement_Token` is only issued when the cryptographic `Proof_of_Physics` is verified.

## 7. Implementation Guide: The JSON Standard
