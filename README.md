# Agent Proof Protocol (APP)
**The universal translation gateway for agentic commerce. Bridging Visa TAP, Google AP2, and Web3.**

### Status: v1.0 (Draft)

## The Mission
The Agent Proof Protocol (APP) acts as the interoperability layer for the Agentic Economy. It translates digital intent into **physical certainty**.

While incumbents like Visa and Google solve for **Identity** and **Intent**, they lack a mechanism to verify **Physical Ground Truth**. APP fills this gap by providing a standardized "Proof of Physics" layer that any agent—regardless of its payment rail—can use to verify that a real-world task was completed.

## Core Architecture
APP functions as a **Translation Gateway** between isolated standards:

* **Ingress:** Accepts payment mandates from **Visa TAP** (Fiat), **Google AP2** (Intent), or **ERC-8004** (Crypto).
* **Verification:** Challenges a human "Sensor" to provide cryptographic **Proof of Physics** (Wi-Fi RTT / Bio-Liveness).
* **Settlement:** Returns a unified `proof_token` that unlocks the escrowed funds on the originating rail.
