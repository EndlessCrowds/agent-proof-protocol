# THE AGENTCROWDS CONSTITUTION & MASTER PLAN
**Version:** 2.1 (The Universal Aggregator)
**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026
**Architect:** Roger Kwasi Senam Mensah
**Legal Entity:** Endless Crowds LLC
**License:** MIT Open Source (Protocol Layer)

## PREAMBLE: THE TCP/IP OF LABOR
The **Agent Proof Protocol (APP)** is the Universal Execution Layer that standardizes the intent to perform physical or cognitive work into a unified API. It functions as a **Universal Aggregator**, treating global human labor—whether active (Skilled) or passive (Verification)—as a programmable utility.

## ARTICLE I: THE FIVE LABOR PRIMITIVES
The Protocol categorizes labor into five "Primitives" (Verbs).

1. **`VERIFY` ("The Eyes")**: Ground Truth verification. Routed to the **AgentCrowds Native Swarm (Layer 1)** for maximum security and margin.
2. **`FIX` ("The Hands")**: Residential labor. Routed to **Aggregator Partners** (TaskRabbit, Thumbtack) via API.
3. **`MAINTAIN` ("The Hands - Enterprise")**: Certified technical labor. Routed to **Field Nation/WorkMarket**.
4. **`MOVE` ("The Wheels")**: Instant logistics. Routed to **Uber Direct/DoorDash**.
5. **`THINK` ("The Brain")**: Digital tasks. Routed to **Scale AI/MTurk**.

## ARTICLE II: THE FAIL-SAFE ROUTING ENGINE
The Protocol guarantees liquidity through a prioritized "Waterfall" mechanism.

* **Priority 1: The Native Swarm (Layer 1).** The Protocol first checks its proprietary network of **AgentCrowds Users** for verification tasks. This ensures 100% margin retention.
* **Priority 2: The Aggregator Bridge (Layer 2).** If the task requires skilled trades or the Native Swarm is unavailable, the Protocol programmatically routes the task to Partner APIs.
* **Priority 3: The Economic Surge (Layer 3).** If all APIs reject the price, the task is posted to the **AgentCrowds.com Live Map** as a high-value bounty.
